        <h2>Ideas</h2>
        <p>Our research, strategy, design, and technology teams dug into the pharma-retail landscape to benchmark competitors and catalog current offerings and trends to provide the context we needed to inform potential solutions. In total, we generated over a dozen concepts to fill the gaps in the areas we identified.</p>

        <h4 class="text-color-blue pt-p">Optical Experience - B2C</h4>
        <p>A multi-device digital solution integrated with augmented reality technology will enhance the traditional retail-optical experience and enable Millennials, Baby Boomers, and everyone in between to browse, try, and buy non-prescription eyeglasses in-store, on the road, or from the comfort of their homes.</p>
<!-- 
        <h4 class="text-color-blue pt-p">2. Reduce Pharma Loss - B2B</h4>
        <p>Every year, stockpiled medications and medical supplies expire before they can help improve the lives of their intended audiences. This digital platform provides pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders visibility to the critical product data (e.g., location, expiration date, time to destination, etc.) to optimize inventory, reduce waste, and boost revenue.</p> -->

        <h4>Configuration 1: Self-Service Experience</h4>
        <p>Our first configuration either relies on modifications to an existing retail display or the fabrication of a new POP display to include a digital interface which serves as the customer's primary point of interaction. The digital interface enables customers to browse Walgreens' full selection of eyeglasses, simplifying the shopping experience and reducing the clutter of the current POP display.</p>

        <p>The native mobile app for iOS and Android picks up where the responsive website leaves off. The native app lets us take advantage of the mobile device's camera to support augmented reality features that enable customers to virtually try-on frames and elevate the experience.</p>

              <p>To use the augmented reality feature the customer simply allows the app to access her device's camera and start the facial scan. The scan captures, stitches together multiple images, and creates a 3D topographic model of her face. The app uses this model to enable the customer to virtually try-on the selected frames.</p>
              <p class="pt-p">The universal app is intended to be used to enable this functionality on both the in-store kiosk and the customer’s mobile device to minimize development costs and maximize impact.</p>
